/**
 * In RAII, holding a resource is tied to object lifetime: resource allocation (acquisition) is done during object creation (specifically initialization), by the constructor, while resource deallocation (release) is done during object destruction, by the destructor. If objects are destroyed properly, resource leaks do not occur.
